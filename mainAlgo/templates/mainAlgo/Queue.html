  <h1>Queue (abstract data type) </h1>
  
  <p>A queue is a collection of entities that are kept in order and can be changed by adding and removing entities from one end of the sequence and the other end of the sequence. The back, tail, or back of the queue is the end of the sequence at which items are added, whereas the head or front of the line is the end of the sequence at which components are withdrawn.<br> Enqueue is the process of putting an element to the back of the queue, whereas dequeue is the process of removing an element from the front. A queue is a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure because of its operations. The first piece added to the queue will be the first one deleted in a FIFO data structure.</P>
